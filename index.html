  <p>Hello, I’m Candice. I am a caring, hard-working, fun person. I love to joke and play around but I work just as hard as I play. I
know with those simple qualities you would think, I didn’t have weakness sadly I do. I can be a big procrastinator on my own time. On work time I
tend to rush to finish the task. I also sometimes have a hard time saying no to people, saying no is the hardest thing to do. My goal is simply to better than yesterday and my
motivators are is my family because I want s
I also don’t always speak up and giving my opinion because I want people to take it the wrong way.</p>
